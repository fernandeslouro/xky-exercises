=== Exercise (MODULE_5) ===

So far, all the exercises we have solved have involved partitions which run 
independently of each other. In this exercise, we will learn about XKY's inter-
partition communication functions. We'll start with queuing ports.

Functions to use:
 - xky_syscall_get_port_id
 - xky_syscall_get_port_status
 - xky_syscall_read_port
 - xky_syscall_write_port
 - xky_syscall_flush_port

===

1. Implement the following partition code:
 - partition_0: initially gets port ID, and prints the port status. After that, 
each time window: 
	1. Sends a number of messages smaller than MaxNbMessages 
	2. Sends a message smaller than MaxMessageSize
 - partition_1: initially gets port ID, and prints the port status. After that, 
each time window:
	1. Read all words on port and checks if is overflowed
	2. Read message and check if the message size overflowed

2. Now change partition_0 to:
	1. Send more messages than MaxNbMessages
	2. Send a message larger than MaxMessageSize
3. Verify that the previous verifications at partition_1 are working properly
