=== Exercise (MODULE_7) ===

Another way of establishing communication between partitions is through shared
memory.

On README:
 - memory regions
 - memory status
 - shared memory

===

1. Add a shared memory to the starter code
2. Get all memory IDs, status, name, adress and size
3. For 10 MTFs:
 - partition_0: Write an integer to shared memory, increasing it every mtf
 - partition_1: read the integer, printing it, as well as the name of the memory 
you read it from
4. Make partition_0 sleep for one mtf and and then, for 10 MTFs:
 - partition_1: Write an integer to shared memory, increasing it every mtf
 - partition_0: read the integer, printing it, as well as the name of the memory 
you read it from
5. Print nemory cache attributes and memory permissions
