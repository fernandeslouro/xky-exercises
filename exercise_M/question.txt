=== Exercise (MODULE_3) ===

This is a more complex timing exercise. Beyond counting local and global elapsed
time, XKY can set timers, which this exercise is about.

Functions to use:
 - xky_syscall_start_timer
 - xky_syscall_get_timer_tps
 - bare_isr_install_handler (used for timer evets)

===

1. For partition_0, set 4 timers (1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and 1 second) using timer events
2. For partition_1, set 2 timers (2 and 4 seconds) using timer events
3. When the timers finish, they should trigger an event that should print the 
current partition, the finished timer and global time
