=== Exercise ===

To add some complexity, we now want do implement an application with 3 partitions,
and a different schedule. You could implement this as a singe schedule, but in 
this exercise you should implement it as two schedules.

Introduced concepts:
 - schedules

===

1. Add a new partition (partition_2)
2. Add a new schedule,  running partition_0 and parition_2 
3. Change between schedules so that the partitions run in the following order: 
0 1 0 2 0 1 0 2
