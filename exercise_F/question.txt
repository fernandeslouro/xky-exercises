=== Exercise ===

We now want to get our partition name from the code, instead of having it
"hard-coded" on the partition code.

New functions to use:
 - xky_syscall_get_partition_id

===

1. Change the partition code so that the partition id is given by functions,
instead of being written directly on the print code
