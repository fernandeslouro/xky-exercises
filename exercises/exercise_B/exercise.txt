=== Exercise ===

In the previous exercise, we ran a previously compiled application on a boards,
which was already placed on the TFTP server. Now, we will be learning the whole
flow, from compiling an application, moving it to the tftp server, and rebooting
the board, so that it boots the new app in the tftp server.

1. Start by compiling the XKY application
2. Move the application to the TFTP server
3. See what is happening with your board, running the screen command
4. Run the powerctlr cycle command with your power line so that the board reboots
5. Exit screen :^)
