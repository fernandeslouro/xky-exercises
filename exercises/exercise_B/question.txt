=== Exercise ===

In the previous exercise, we ran a previously compiled application on a board,
which was already placed on the TFTP server. Now, we will be learning the whole
flow, from compiling an application, moving it to the tftp server, and rebooting
the board, so that it boots the new app in the tftp server.

Note that we are still not developing the code ourselves, since we are compiling a
previously developed application.

===

1. Compile the XKY application, running XKY's xmf_make in the app directory 
    "../../../XKY/install/xmf_make", or use the absolute path of xmf_make
2. Change to the "executable" directory "cd executable/"
3. Move the application to the TFTP  server, while renaming it to your "Boot App"
    name "cp XKYAPP.bin /var/lib/tftpboot/<your_boot_app>"
4. See the serial output of your  board, running "cat /opt/shortc/<your_board>
    (or the alias, "ct_<your_board>")
5. Reboot your board with "ima_powerctrl cycle <your_power_line>"
