=== Exercise (MODULE_0) ===

This exercise is about accessing information about partitions, as well
as changing the current state of partitions. You should figure out how to 
implement the sequence below, making use of the concepts introduced in previous 
exercises and the new functions.

Some functions you should use during this exercise:
 - get_partition_id
 - get_partition_status
 - set_partition_mode
 - bare_wake_next_mtf
 - permissions on accessing other partition mode and status

===

1. Implement the following sequence of commands:
 - time step 1: partition_0 gets its own ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 2: partition_1 gets its own ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 3: partition_0 gets partition_1's ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 4: partition_1 gets partition_0's ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 5: partition_0 sets partition_1 to IDLE, prints partition_1 status, and then sets its own state to IDLE
 - Both partitions should then be stopped
