=== Exercise (MODULE_0) ===

This exercise is about accessing information about partitions, as well
as changing the current state of partitions. You should figure out how to 
implement the sequence below, making use of the concepts introduced in previous 
exercises and the new functions.

Some functions you should use during this exercise:
 - get_partition_id
 - get_partition_status
 - set_partition_mode
 - bare_wake_next_mtf
 - permissions on accessing other partition mode and status

===

1. Implement the following sequence of commands:
 - time step 1: P1 Gets its own ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 2: P2 Gets its own ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 3: P1 Gets P2's ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 4: P2 Gets P1's ID and Status and prints them
 - time step 5: P1 Sets P2 to IDLE, prints P2 status, and then sets its own state to IDLE
 - Both partitions should then be stopped
