=== Exercise ===

We now want to develop a slightly more complex application. The questions below
will guide you through developing an application of increasing complexity, 
while introducing you to the use of different XKY concepts.

Introduced concepts:
 - using several partitions

1. Implement the same application, but now printing a message in two partitions. 
2. Now change the functions so that the prints run on endless loops.
