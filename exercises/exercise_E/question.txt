=== Exercise ===

What if we don't want to run the prints this many times, but we still want them 
to run in every schedule? XKY has this capablity

Introduced concepts:
 - mtf events stuff
 - partition running times

1. Now make each print once every MTF. Use the function wait_in_next_mtf
2. Now make partitions take half as long a time to run
