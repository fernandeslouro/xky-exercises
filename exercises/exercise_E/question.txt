We now want to develop a slightly more complex application. The next several
questions below will guide you through developing an application of increasing
 complexity, while introducing you to the use of different XKY concepts.

Introduced concepts:
 - using several partitions

1. Add a second partition to the code also printing a simple message
3. Now change the functions so that the prints run on endless loops. It should 
print the message many times.
