=== Exercise ===

We' ve previously learned how to see the output of running an XKY application.
For that, we need to compile the application, move the binary to the TFTP server,
and then reboot the power on the board, so that we can then see the serial output
using 'cat' or 'screen'.

We have simplified this process using a python script, called xky_deploy

Implement:
1. Run the script using 'xky_deploy <xky_folder> <app_folder> -rfc <your_board>
