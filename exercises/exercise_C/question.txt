=== Exercise ===

We' ve previously learned how to see the output of running an XKY application.

For that, we need to:
 - compile the application
 - rename the binary and move it to the TFTP server
 - reboot the power on the board
 - see the serial output using 'cat' or 'screen'

We have simplified this process using a python script, called xky_deploy.

===

1. Run the script using 'xky_deploy <xky_folder> <app_folder> -rfc <your_board>'
