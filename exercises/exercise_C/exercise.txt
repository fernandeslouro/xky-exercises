=== Exercise ===

So far, we have only compiled applications we did not write. In this exercise, we
want to build a very simple XKY application. This app should have a single partition,
which only prints "Hello World!" and then if should exit. 

You should start writing this application based on the boilerplate code in the
folder "boilerplate app". Other apps we will write on this course will all be
based on this one.

1. Create the necessary files, but leave them empty
2. Write the XML file for the application
3. Write the XML file for the partition
4. Write the C code with "hello world"
