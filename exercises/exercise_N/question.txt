=== Exercise (MODULE_5) ===

So far, all the exercises we have solved have involved partitions which run 
independently of each other. In this exercise, we will learn about XKY's inter-
partition communication functions. We'll start with queuing ports.

TODO: Make sure the exercise specifically makes use of flush_port

Functions to use:
 - get_port_id
 - get_port_status
 - flush_port
 - read_port
 - write_port

===

 - P1 initially gets port ID, and prints the port status, after that, : 
	1. Sends a number of messages less than MaxNbMessages
	2. Sends a message smaller than MaxMessageSize
 - P2 initially gets port ID, and prints the port status, after that, each time window :
	1. Read all words on port and checks if is overflowed
	2. Read message and check if the message size overflowed
And then:
 - Now change the partition P1 to
	1. Sends more messages than MaxNbMessages
	2. Sends a message larger than MaxMessageSize
 - Verify that the previous verifications at P2 are working properly
