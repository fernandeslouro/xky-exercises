=== Exercise ===

To add some complexity, we now want do implement an application with 3 partitions,
and a different schedule. You could implement this as a singe schedule, but in 
this exercise you should implement it as two schedules.

Introduced concepts:
 - schedules

1. Now add a third partition, making partitions run as 1 2 3 1 2 3.
2. Change the schedule to run as 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 3
