=== Exercise (MODULE_1) ===

In this exercise, we will be using XKY's functions to get information about the
current schedule

This exercise has some similarities to the precious one, but focuses on XKY's 
functions related to schedules, while the previous one focused on partition-related 
functions. Implement the sequence below.

Functions to be used:
 - get_schedule_id
 - get_schedule_status
 - set_module_schedule
 - set_schedule
 - permissions on changing the module schedule

Easy:
 - just run get_schedule_id and get_schedule status

Implement:
 - P1 from time window to time window changes what it does using bare_wake_in_next_mtf
	1. Prints schedule ID (though: should also add schedule_status, check feasibility)
	2. Changes schedule 
 - P2 and P3 Prints schedule ID
