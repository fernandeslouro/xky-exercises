=== Exercise ===

For our first exercise, the goal is to get comfortable with the workflow of 
running xky applications on the boards connected to our server (Phantom).

When a board is powered up, it is programmed to try a TFTP boot. What this means
is that when it is powered on, it will look for a file with a specific name on
the TFPT server at 192.168.0.2 and it will boot this file.

For this exercise, you should not concern yourself with the application being 
loaded. We simply want to look at the serial output of our boards, and them
perform a power cycle so that the binary is booted by the board, and we can see
the output

1. Run "cat /opt/shortc/<your_board_name>"
2. While maintaining the first terminal window open, run 
      "ima_powerctrl cycle <your_power_line_number>"
3. What do you see on the serial output window?
