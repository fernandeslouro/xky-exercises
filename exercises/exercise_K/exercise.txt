=== Exercise (MODULE_3) ===

This is a more complex timers exercise. Instead of getting the elapsed time, we
are now using timers, as well as timer evets.   

Functions to use:
 - get_timer_tps
 - start_timer

On the README:
      partition timers
      diferent timer expiration per partition
      timer events

Implement:
 - Set 4 Different timers for each partition, that will trigger an event that 
 will print Global time , Local Time and the information of which timer was reached
