=== Exercise (MODULE_2) ===



Functions to use:
 - bare_isr_handler_f
 - bare_isr_install_handler

On the Readme:
      scheduling events without polling the schedule status 
      does the same of the previous module but using events (similar timings)

===

1. Change the previous example to use events instead of the bare_wake_in_next_mtf
