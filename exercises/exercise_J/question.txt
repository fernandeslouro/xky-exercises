=== Exercise (MODULE_1) ===

In this exercise, we will be using XKY's functions to get information about the
current schedule. This exercise has some similarities to the previous one, but
focuses on XKY's functions related to schedules, while the previous one focused 
on partition-related functions.

Functions to be used:
 - get_schedule_id
 - get_schedule_status
 - set_module_schedule
 - set_schedule
 - permissions on changing the module schedule

===

1. Implement the following partition code:
 - partition_0: every time P1 runs, it should switch between 2 operations:
	1. Prints schedule ID
	2. Changes between schedule_0 and schedule_1
 - partition_1: prints schedule ID 
 - partition_2: prints schedule ID 
2. Implement the following schedule sequence
 - schedule_0: 0 1
 - schedule_1: 0 1 2
