=== Exercise ===

What if we don't want to run the prints this many times, but we still want them 
to run in every schedule?

Introduced concepts:
 - mtf events stuff
 - partition running times

===

1. Now make each print once every instead of many times in each time frame
2. Now make partitions take half as long a time to run
