=== Exercise 2 ===

In this exercise, we will be using XKY's functions to get information about the
current schedule

Functions to be used:

 - get_schedule_status
 - set_module_schedule
 - permissions on changing the module schedule



= Question 2.1 = 

Print the schedule id of two partitions

= Question 2.2 =

Print the schedule status of two partitions, with the things it contains

= Question 2.3 =

Using set_module_schedule and then checking the schedule status again, some 
exercise about this, still not completely clear how I would do it.
